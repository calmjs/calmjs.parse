    Provide storage and lookup for the stored definitions and the
    handlers, which is documented by the constructor below.

    The instances of this class will be a callable that accept a single
    argument; when called with an object, the handling function, if any,
    will be returned to achieve the generation of output chunks.

    Calling on an instance of this object with a Rule (typically either
    a Token instance, or a Layout type/class object) will return the
    associated handler that was set up initially for a given instance.

    Accessing via a Node type as a key will return the definition that
    was initially set up for a given instance.

    The default implementation also provide a couple properties for ease
    of layout customization, which are the indent character and the
    newline character.  As certain users and/or platforms expect certain
    character sequences for these outputs, they can be specified in the
    constructor for this class, or be completely ignored by the specific
    layout handlers.

    An `error_handler` static method is provided by this class, which
    may be invoked (typically by the walk function) to signal an error.
    This default implementation will simply raise the exception passed.
    Subclasses may simply override this static method, or may simply
    assign a callable to an instance that accepts the same arguments
    for the handling of exceptions.

    While this class can be used (it was originally conceived) as a
    generic object that allow arbitrary assignments of arguments for
    consumption by layout functions, it's better to have a dedicated
    class that provide instance methods that plug into this.  See the
    modules inside ``calmjs.parse.handlers`` for various examples on
    how this could be set up.  To better maintain object purity, users
    of this class should not assign additional state attributes to
    instances of this class.
