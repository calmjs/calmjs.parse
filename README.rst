Introduction
------------

For any kind of build system that operates with JavaScript code in
conjunction with a module system, the ability to understand what modules
a given set of sources require or provide is paramount.  As the Calmjs
project provides a framework that produces and consume these module
definitions, the the ability to have a comprehensive understanding of
given JavaScript sources is a given.  This goal was originally achieved
using |slimit|_, a JavaScript minifier library that also provided a
comprehensive parser class that was built using Python Lex-Yacc (i.e.
|ply|_).

However, as of mid-2017, it was noted that |slimit| remained in a
minimum state of maintenance for more than four years (its most recent
release, 0.8.1, was made 2013-03-26), along with a number of serious
outstanding issues have left unattended and unresolved for the duration
of that timespan.  As the development of the Calmjs framework require
those issues to be rectified as soon as possible, a decision to fork the
parser portion of |slimit| was made. This was done in order to cater to
the interests current to Calmjs project at that moment in time.

The fork was initial cut from another fork of |slimit| (specifically
`lelit/slimit <https://github.com/lelit/slimit>`_), as it introduced and
aggregated a number of bug fixes from various sources.  To ensure a
better quality control and assurance, a number of problematic changes
introduced by that fork were removed.   Also, new tests were created to
bring coverage to full, and issues reported on the |slimit| tracker were
noted and formalized into test cases where applicable.  Finally, grammar
rules were updated to ensure better conformance with the ECMA-262 (ES5)
specification.

The goal of |calmjs.parse| is to provide a similar parser API as the
parser that |slimit| had provided.  The mangling and minification
functionalities as provided by the original has been omitted as they are
not relevant to code parsing.  A separate package containing those
mangling and minifying features as provided by |slimit| may be released
in the future.


Installation
------------

The following command may be executed to source the |calmjs.parse| wheel
from PyPI for installation into the current Python environment.

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install calmjs.parse

As this package uses |ply|, which produces auto-generated modules that
are shipped with the Python wheel for this package, this results in some
caveats.  The modules at hand contain generated tables for |ply|; the
wheel for this package will be compatible up to ``ply-3.10``, or the
latest release available at the time of release of |calmjs.parse|.  If a
more recent version of |ply| becomes available and is installed, the
generated tables in this package may become incompatible, thus a manual
optimization step outlined later in this document may be required.
Alternatively, |ply| may be downgraded to version 3.10.

Alternative installation methods (for developers, advanced users)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Development is still ongoing with |calmjs.parse|, for the latest
features and bug fixes, the development version may be installed through
git like so:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/calmjs/calmjs.parse.git#egg=calmjs.parse

Alternatively, the git repository can be cloned directly and execute
``python setup.py develop`` while inside the root of the source
directory.

A manual optimization step may need to be performed for platforms and
systems that do not have utf8 as their default encoding.

Manual optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As lex and yacc require the generation of symbol tables, a way to
optimize the performance is to cache the results.  For |ply|, this is
done using an autogenerated module.  However, the generated file is
marked with a version number, as the results may be specific to the
installed version of |ply|.  In |calmjs.parse| this is handled by giving
them a name specific to the version of |ply| and the major Python
version, as both together does result in subtle differences in the
outputs and expectations of the auto-generated modules.

Typically, the process for this optimization is automatic and a correct
symbol table will be generated, however there are cases where this will
fail, so for this reason |calmjs.parse| provide a helper module and
executable that can be optionally invoked to ensure that the correct
encoding be used to generate that file.  Other reasons where this may be
necessary is to allow system administrators to do so for their end
users, as they may not have write privileges at that level.

To execute the optimizer from the shell, the provided helper script may
be used like so:

.. code:: sh

    $ python -m calmjs.parse.parsers.optimize

If warnings appear that warn that tokens are defined but not used, they
may be safely ignored.

This step is generally optionally for users who installed this package
from PyPI via a Python wheel, provided the caveats as outlined in the
installation section are addressed.

Testing the installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that the |calmjs.parse| installation is functioning correctly,
the built-in testsuite can be executed by the following:

.. code:: sh

    $ python -m unittest calmjs.parse.tests.make_suite

If there are failures, please file an issue on the issue tracker with
the full traceback, and/or the method of installation.  Please also
remember to include platform specific information, such as Python
version, operating system environments, the version of |ply| that was
installed, plus other information related to the issue at hand.


Usage
-----

As this is a parser library, no executable shell commands are provided.
There is however a helper function provided at the top level for
immediate access to the parsing feature.  It may be used like so:

.. code:: python

    >>> from calmjs.parse import es5
    >>> program = es5('''
    ... // simple program
    ... var main = function(greet) {
    ...     var hello = "hello " + greet;
    ...     return hello;
    ... };
    ... console.log(main('world'));
    ... ''')
    >>> program  # for a simple repr-like nested view of the ast
    <ES5Program ?children=[
      <VarStatement ?children=[
        <VarDecl identifier=<Identifier ...>, initializer=<FuncExpr ...>>
      ]>,
      <ExprStatement expr=<FunctionCall args=[
        <FunctionCall ...>
      ], identifier=<DotAccessor ...>>>
    ]>
    >>> print(program)  # automatic reconstruction of ast into source
    var main = function(greet) {
      var hello = "hello " + greet;
      return hello;
    };
    console.log(main('world'));

The parser classes are organized under the ``calmjs.parse.parsers``
module, with each language being under their own module.  A
corresponding lexer class with the same name is also provided under the
``calmjs.parse.lexers`` module.  For the moment, only ES5 support is
implemented.

AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) visitor classes are defined under the
appropriate named modules under ``calmjs.parse.visitors``; please refer
to their docstrings for documentation on their usage.  A quick example
to show how the es5 visitor may be used to regenerate the source tree
back into text for the above example (in fact, the ``__str__`` call
shown in the first example generates the output like so).

.. code:: python

    >>> from calmjs.parse.visitors.es5 import PrettyPrinter
    >>> visitor = PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
    >>> print(visitor.visit(program))
    var main = function(greet) {
        var hello = "hello " + greet;
        return hello;
    };
    console.log(main('world'));

Note the change in indentation and the lack of comments, as this visitor
implementation has their own indentation scheme and the parser currently
skips over comments.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Instantiation the parser fails with ``UnicodeEncodeError``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For platforms or systems that do not have utf8 configured as the default
encoding, the automatic table generation may fail when constructing a
parser instance.  An example:

.. code:: python-doctest

    >>> from calmjs.parse.parsers import es5
    >>> parser = es5.Parser()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      File "c:\python35\lib\site-packages\ply-3.10-py3.5.egg\ply\lex.py", line 1043, in lex
        lexobj.writetab(lextab, outputdir)
      File "c:\python35\lib\site-packages\ply-3.10-py3.5.egg\ply\lex.py", line 195, in writetab
        tf.write('_lexstatere   = %s\n' % repr(tabre))
      File "c:\python35\lib\encodings\cp1252.py", line 19, in encode
        return codecs.charmap_encode(input,self.errors,encoding_table)[0]
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u02c1' in position 2488: character maps to <undefined>

A workaround helper script is provided, it may be executed like so:

.. code:: sh

    $ python -m calmjs.parse.parsers.optimize
