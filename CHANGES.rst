Changelog
=========

?.?.? - ????-??-??
------------------

- Correct the JoinAttr ruletype such that the intended empty definition
  value is passed to walk if it was defined as such to avoid an
  unintended infinite recursion.

1.0.1 - 2018-04-19
------------------

- Ensure that the es5 Unparser pass on the prewalk_hooks argument in
  its constructor.
- Minor packaging fixes; also include optimization modules for ply-3.11.

1.0.0 - 2017-09-26
------------------

Full support for sourcemaps; changes that make it possible follows:

- High level read/write functionality provided by a new ``io`` module.
- There is now a ``Deferrable`` rule type for marking certain Tokens
  that need extra handling.  The support for this has changed the
  various API that deals with setting up of this.
- For support of the sourcemap generation, a number of new ruletypes
  have been added.
- The sourcemap write function had its argument order modified to
  better support the sourcepath tracking feature of input Nodes.  Its
  return value also now match the ordering of the encode_sourcemap
  function.
- The chunk types in ruletypes have been renamed, and also a new type
  called StreamFragment is introduced, so that multiple sources output
  to a single stream can be properly tracked by the source mapping
  processes.
- `rspivak/slimit#66 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/66>`_
  should be fully supported now.

Minify printer now has ability to shorten/obfuscate identifiers:

- Provide a name obfuscation function for shortening identifiers, to
  further achieve minified output.  Note that this does not yet fully
  achieve the level of minification ``slimit`` had; future versions
  may implement this functionality as various AST transformations.
- Also provided ability to drop unneeded semicolons.

Other significant changes:

- Various changes to internal class and function names for the 1.0.0
  release.  A non exhaustive listing of changes to modules relative to
  the root of this package name as compared to previous major release
  follows:

  ``asttypes``
    - All ``slimit`` compatibility features removed.
    - ``Switch`` (the incorrect version) removed.
    - ``SwitchStatement`` -> ``Switch``
    - ``SetPropAssign`` constructor: ``parameters`` -> ``parameter``
    - ``UnaryOp`` -> ``UnaryExpr``
    - Other general deprecated features also removed.
  ``factory``
    - ``Factory`` -> ``SRFactory``
  ``visitors``
    - Removed (details follow).
  ``walkers``
    - ``visitors.generic.ReprVisitor`` -> ``walkers.ReprWalker``
  ``layouts``
    - Module was split and reorganised; the simple base ones can be
      found in ``handlers.core``, the indentation related features are
      now in ``handlers.indentation``.
  ``unparsers.base``
    - ``.default_layout_handlers`` -> ``handlers.core.default_rules``
    - ``.minimum_layout_handlers`` -> ``handlers.core.minimum_rules``
  ``unparsers.prettyprint``
    - Renamed to ``unparsers.walker``.
    - The implementation was actually standard tree walking, no
      correctly implemented visitor functions/classes were ever present.
  ``vlq``
    - ``.create_sourcemap`` -> ``sourcemap.create_sourcemap``

- Broke up the visitors class as they weren't really visitors as
  described.  The new implementations (calmjs.parse-0.9.0) were really
  walkers, so move them to that name and leave it at that.  Methods
  were also renamed to better reflect their implementation and purpose.
- Many slimit compatibility modules, classes and incorrectly implemented
  functionalities removed.
- The usage of the Python 3 ``str`` type (``unicode`` in Python 2) is
  now enforced for the parser, to avoid various failure cases where
  mismatch types occur.
- The base Node asttype has a sourcepath attribute which is to be used
  for tracking the original source of the node; if assigned, all its
  subnodes without sourcepath defined should be treated as from that
  source.
- Also provide an even higher level function for usage with streams
  through the ``calmjs.parse.io`` module.
- Semicolons and braces added as structures to be rendered.

Bug fixes:

- Functions starting with a non-word character will now always have a
  whitespace rendered before it to avoid syntax error.
- Correct an incorrect iterator usage in the walk function.
- Ensure List separators don't use the rowcol positions of a subsequent
  Elision node.
- Lexer will only report real lexer tokens on errors (ASI generated
  tokens are now dropped as they don't exist in the original source
  which results in confusing rowcol reporting).
- `rspivak/slimit#57 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/57>`_,
  as it turns out ``'\0'`` is not considered to be octal, but is a <NUL>
  character, which the rule to parse was not actually included in the
  lexer patches that were pulled in previous to this version.
- `rspivak/slimit#75 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/75>`_,
  Option for shadowing of names of named closures, which is now disabled
  by default (obfuscated named closures will not be shadowed by other
  obfuscated names in children).
- Expressions can no longer contain an unnamed function.

0.10.1 - 2017-08-26
-------------------

- Corrected the line number reporting for the lexer, and correct the
  propagation of that to the parser and the Node subclasses.  Fixes the
  incorrect implementation added by `moses-palmer/slimit@8f9a39c7769
  <https://github.com/moses-palmer/slimit/commit/8f9a39c7769>`_ (where
  the line numbers are tabulated incorrectly when comments are present,
  and also the yacc tracking added by `moses-palmer/slimit@6aa92d68e0
  <https://github.com/moses-palmer/slimit/commit/6aa92d68e0>`_ (where
  the custom lexer class does not provide the position attributes
  required by ply).
- Implemented bookkeeping of column numbers.
- Made other various changes to AST but for compatibility reasons (to
  not force a major semver bump) they are only enabled with a flag to
  the ES5 parser.
- Corrected a fault with how switch/case statements are handled in a way
  that may break compatibility; fixes are only enabled when flagged.
  `rspivak/slimit#94 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/94>`_
- The repr form of Node now shows the line/col number info by default;
  the visit method of the ReprVisitor class have not been changed, only
  the invocation of it via the callable form has as that is the call
  target for __repr__.  This is a good time to mention that named
  methods afford the most control for usage as documented already.
- Parsers now accept an asttypes module during its construction.
- Provide support for source map generation classes.
- Introduced a flexible visitor function/state class that accepts a
  definition of rules for the generation of chunk tuples that are
  compatible for the source map generation.  A new way for pretty
  printing and minification can be achieved using this module.

0.9.0 - 2017-06-09
------------------

- Initial release of the fork of ``slimit.parser`` and its parent
  modules as ``calmjs.parse``.
- This release brings in a number of bug fixes that were available via
  other forks of ``slimit``, with modifications or even a complete
  revamp.
- Issues addressed includes:

  - `rspivak/slimit#52 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/52>`_,
    `rspivak/slimit#59 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/59>`_,
    `rspivak/slimit#81 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/81>`_,
    `rspivak/slimit#90 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/90>`_
    (relating to conformance of ecma-262 7.6 identifier names)
  - `rspivak/slimit#54 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/54>`_
    (fixed by tracking scope and executable current token in lexer)
  - `rspivak/slimit#57 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/57>`_,
    `rspivak/slimit#70 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/70>`_
    (octal encoding (e.g \0), from `redapple/slimit@a93204577f
    <https://github.com/redapple/slimit/commit/a93204577f>`_)
  - `rspivak/slimit#62 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/62>`_
    (formalized into a unittest that passed)
  - `rspivak/slimit#73 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/73>`_
    (specifically the desire for a better repr; the minifier bits are
    not relevant to this package)
  - `rspivak/slimit#79 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/pull/79>`_
    (tab module handling was completely reimplemented)
  - `rspivak/slimit#82 <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/issues/82>`_
    (formalized into a unittest that passed)

- Include various changes gathered by `rspivak/slimit#65
  <https://github.com/rspivak/slimit/pull/65>`_, which may be the source
  of some of the fixes listed above.
